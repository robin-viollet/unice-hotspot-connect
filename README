# Unice Login app
This is useful to connect to the Unice Hotspot wifi of the UCA university without opening a web browser.

This first version is the first working version. It doesn't save the credentials (but support
password manager auto-completion) and one-tap connect (if the app saved the logins it could auto-connect on launch).

This app is provided as-is as a proof of concept. It is not expected to work nor to be secure and isn't endorsed by the UCA.
